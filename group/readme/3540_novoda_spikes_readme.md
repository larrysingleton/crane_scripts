# Spikes

![Novoda](https://blog.novoda.com/content/images/2016/11/novoda-logo-transparent-1.png)

This is where we explore new ideas, hack around bug fixes and spark new code babies.

Each top-level folder in this repository represents a spike that the Novoda team has worked on at some point in time. Explore the folder contents to find out more about these spikes.

## Graduating out of spikes
When something matures and becomes big enough to deserve its own repository, Novodians can [split out](https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subpath-out-into-a-new-repository/) the history of that project's folder into a new repository. If something isn't big enough to deserve its own repo it should be moved to [`android-demos`](https://github.com/novoda/android-demos) or [`ios-demos`](https://github.com/novoda/ios-demos).
