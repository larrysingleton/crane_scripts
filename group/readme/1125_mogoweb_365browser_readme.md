# 365 Browser
A lightweight android browser based on chromium for android. You can visit my blog site [http://mogoweb.github.io/mogo-browser/](http://mogoweb.github.io/mogo-browser/) for more information, but written in Chinese. 

## Why you need
In 2015, Google releases full source of chromium for android, including browser UI. It means that base on chromium open source project, you can build an android browser as powerful as Chrome for Android. But for most android developer, chromium project is huge and difficult to customize. This project extracts sources and libraries built from chromium, so that you can put emphasis on UI customize. Please use Android Studio as your development environment. 

## Get the Code

Check out the repository in your Android Studio workspace, and open the project in Android Studio. Then build, debug, run as a normal android project.

Have a fun :)
