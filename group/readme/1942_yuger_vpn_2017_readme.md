OpenVPN for Android
=================================
OpenVpn Android client, simplified from [ics-openvpn](https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn).

You should prepare your own `client.ovpn` file in the assets folder, which decode in [here](https://github.com/yuger/VPN_2017/blob/master/vpn2017/src/main/java/com/wxy/vpn/MainActivity.java#L86).
And you may translate the OpenVPN Android client into your native language.
